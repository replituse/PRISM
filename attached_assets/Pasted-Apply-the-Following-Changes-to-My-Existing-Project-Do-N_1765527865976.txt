Apply the Following Changes to My Existing Project

(Do NOT change major functionality, structure, or design.)

1️⃣ Chalan Must Have a Unique Chalan ID

Add a unique chalan_id for every chalan created.

Format can be: CHL-000001, CHL-000002… OR use auto-increment with prefix.

Ensure unique ID is returned and displayed everywhere (reports, view chalan, booking details).

NO change in existing DB structure (use existing fields or generate ID in backend).

2️⃣ Schedule Booking → Default Date Must Be Today

When user clicks Schedule Booking, open booking form with:

Current date auto-filled

User should not need to pick a date manually

Other behavior remains exactly as it is.

3️⃣ Booking Dashboard – Show Only 2 Items + “+2/+3 More” → Open Day View

Dashboard booking cell should initially display only 2 records.

If more records exist, show "+2 more" / "+3 more", etc.

Clicking the “+X more” opens Day View in full screen, not popup.

Inside Day View, keep the 3-dots menu fully functional:

View Logs

Create Chalan

View Chalan

Cancel Booking

4️⃣ Fix Chalan Creation Error (See Screenshot)

Error: “Expected string, received number (totalAmount)”

Fix:

Update backend API validation to accept number for:

totalAmount

grandTotal

amount

rate

Convert numbers to string internally ONLY if the existing system requires it — but do not break any existing logic.

Fix chalan generation from booking page and direct chalan module:

Chalan must successfully create

Must store decimal values

Must allow viewing after creation

5️⃣ Conflict Report – Add “Update” Button + Update Form

Enhance conflict report without UI redesign:

Conflict report must show:

Keep This

Update (NEW)

Update button behavior:

Opens booking form for that conflict booking.

Shows the conflict warning clearly.

Allows user to edit (reschedule or modify fields).

Once conflict is resolved:

Record should automatically disappear from conflict report.

Updated booking must reflect correctly in:

Dashboard

Booking list

Reports

Chalan (if applicable)

6️⃣ Fix All Filters in Reports + Conflict Report

Filters must work properly:

By month

By single date

By date range (From → To)

By customer

By project

By company

Smooth data loading

No delay, no blank results

Fix filters in:

Conflict Report

Booking Report

Chalan Report

Customer Report

All other modules using date/sort filters

7️⃣ Day View → “New Booking” Button Not Working

Fix the button so that:

Clicking New Booking in Day View opens full booking form

Default date should be the same day currently viewed

No popup; open the regular booking creation screen

8️⃣ User Edit Screen – Fix Alignment & Full Editability

Inside login user account screen:

All input fields should be editable

Icons must align properly

Text fields should be readable

UI spacing and alignment must be corrected
(No design change — just fix alignment and usability.)

9️⃣ User Management – Enforce Strict Role-Based Access

When admin assigns a role to another user:

Must restrict complete system access exactly as assigned:

For example:

If admin gives access only to:

Booking Dashboard

Reports
→ Then the user should see only these 2 modules in sidebar.

Access levels:

For each module:

View

Edit

Delete

Create

Generate Chalan

Cancel Booking

Access Reports

etc.

If user has only view, they must not be able to:

Edit booking

Delete booking

Create or edit chalan

Delete chalan

Generate reports

Edit customer/projects/etc.

Required:

Strict permission check in both frontend & backend.

Do NOT modify overall design — only enforce correct access control.

🔟 Fix Company Login Selection

Use the following login credentials and ensure company selection works properly:

PRISM:

Username: admin

PIN: 1234

Airavata Studio:

Username: airavata_admin

PIN: 1234

Fix:

Company dropdown must be selectable

Must load dynamically

Must pass selected company_id to backend

Must show only the logged-in company in header and all modules

1️⃣1️⃣ Insert Demo Data – 20 Records Per Module (Except Users)

Add 20 demo records in:

Booking

Customers

Projects

Rooms

Editors

Reports

Chalan

Conflict Records (2–3 conflict entries)

Roles & Utilities

Demo data requirements:

Realistic fields

Proper interlinked data

Booking → Customer → Project → Room → Editor → Chalan

Conflicts generated for at least 2–3 bookings

User Demo Data:

Only 3 users must be created:

admin – full access

gst_member – booking + report access

accountant – can only create/view chalan (no booking edits)

✅ Deliver What I Expect Back

Unique chalan ID

Full day view working

Conflict update flow working

Reports filters fixed

Role rights fully enforced

Company login fix

Demo data insert

No major functional or design changes
