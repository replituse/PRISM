Project Context:
This is a Post-Production Studio Management Software (PRISM) with modules:

Operations (Booking, Leave Entry, Chalan, Chalan Revise)

Masters (Customer, Project, Room, Editor, Users)

Reports (Booking, Conflict, Editor, Chalan, Leave)

Utility (User Rights & Role Access)

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU:

❌ Do NOT change any existing UI design, layout, theme, structure, or navigation

✅ Only fix workflow, logic, permissions, reports, syncing, validations & bugs

✅ Use existing database only (NO DB structure change unless absolutely required)

✅ Add only light, normal color combination for better readability (no redesign)

✅ Make all modules properly connected and live-sync updated

✅ 1. BOOKING MODULE – COMPLETE WORKFLOW FIX

Fix the full real-life workflow as per these rules:

Calendar based booking by Room & Date

Fields:
Customer, Project, Room, Editor, Contact Person, From Time, To Time, Actual From Time, Actual To Time, Break Hours, Total Hours, Status (Planning, Tentative, Confirmed), Cancel Flag

✅ Logic Rules:

Cancel Booking:

Once cancelled, it must lock editing

Show vertical cancellation mark

Save cancellation reason

Conflict Handling:

If Editor OR Room = Ignore Conflict, allow duplicate booking

If NOT ignore conflict → block duplicate booking

On save → show Conflict Alert with count

Billing Logic:

Final Billing Time = (From–To) – (Actual Time – Break Hours)


Repeat Booking:

Clicking Project Name → Open Repeat Dialog

Select multiple days → auto create bookings

Apply same conflict logic

Once Chalan or Invoice generated → Show flag on Project (Yes/No)

Hover / Click Booking → Show Footer Logs:

Left Log: Contact Person, Mobile, Remarks

Right Log: Full change history with timestamp (Editor, Date, Time, Status, Room, Project)

✅ After every new booking → auto update:

Booking Report

Conflict Report

Editor Report

Chalan Pending Report

✅ 2. LEAVE ENTRY (EDITOR)

Fields: Editor, Leave From, Leave To, Notes

Prevent booking on leave dates

Leave entries must reflect in:

Conflict Report

Booking Warnings

✅ 3. CHALAN ENTRY & CHALAN REVISE (CRITICAL FIX)

Chalan must be:

Generated only from Confirmed Booking

Linked to Project + Customer

Chalan Revise:

Allow edit of existing chalan only

Maintain revision history

Cancelled Chalan:

Must display in Chalan Report if checkbox selected

Print cancelled chalan slip properly

✅ 4. MASTER MODULE – DATA FLOW FIX
✅ Customer Master:

Multiple Contact Persons for each customer (second table)

No delete → Only Active / Inactive

Double click → Open edit

Customer Name & Short Name mandatory

✅ Project Master:

Customer & Contact Person → Auto pulled from Customer Master

Project Type:
Movie, Teaser, Advertise, Serial, Web Series, Trilogy

Project Type must auto-save & reappear in dropdown
