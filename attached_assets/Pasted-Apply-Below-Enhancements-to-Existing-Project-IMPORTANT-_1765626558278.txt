Apply Below Enhancements to Existing Project

IMPORTANT:
Work only on my existing project.
Do NOT change major functionality, working flow, structure, database schema, or UI design.
Only add, fix, and enhance features exactly as described below.

1️⃣ Add Soft Reload / Sync Button (Global Data Refresh)

Add a soft reload (sync) button for data refresh.

Requirements:

Position the reload button:

Top right corner OR

Right side of booking summary counters
(Planning / Tentative / Confirmed / Cancelled)

Button behavior:

Fetch latest data from backend

Refresh UI without full page reload

Show loading indicator during fetch

Apply this reload button in every major module:

Booking Dashboard

Master modules

Reports

Chalan

Conflict Report

Use this button as reference/sync data refresh across project.

2️⃣ Chalan Entry – Active / Inactive Toggle (No Popup)

In Chalan Entry, replace any popup status change with:

Inline Active / Inactive toggle button

Toggle must:

Update database instantly

Reflect status immediately in UI

Respect user permissions

Keep existing layout intact.

3️⃣ Delete Action – Permanent DB Delete

In Action column, when user clicks Delete:

Permanently delete record from database

Remove record immediately from UI

No soft delete, no hide-only logic.

Show confirmation dialog before delete.

Apply this logic consistently across all modules.

4️⃣ User Management – Status Toggle

In User Management, add:

Active / Inactive toggle in Status column

Same behavior as:

Customer Master

Project Master

Toggle must:

Update DB

Immediately reflect in UI

Prevent inactive users from login/access

5️⃣ Temporary Hardcoded Companies for Login (Stored in DB)

Temporarily configure two companies:

PRISM

AIRAVATA STUDIO

Requirements:

Insert these companies into database

Login page company dropdown should load only these two

Selected company must:

Be stored in session

Reflect across header and all modules

Keep logic flexible for future dynamic companies.

6️⃣ User Roles – No Hardcoded GST / Non-GST Users

Fix user role logic.

Required:

Remove any hardcoded GST / Non-GST user logic

Only Admin should exist by default:

Full access

Admin can create users with custom permissions:

View only

Edit only

Delete

Create

Chalan access

Booking access

Report access

UI and backend must strictly enforce permissions:

Hide buttons

Block API access

Example:

If user has Booking – View Only:

Can view booking

Cannot edit, delete, cancel, or create booking

⚠️ Important Notes

Do NOT change DB schema unless absolutely required.

Do NOT redesign UI.

Do NOT break existing workflows.

Follow existing coding standards.

✅ Expected Outcome

Global soft reload button works everywhere

Chalan status toggle inline

Delete action permanently removes records

User status toggle works

Company login fixed with PRISM & AIRAVATA STUDIO

Role-based access fully controlled by admin
